I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electronic Engineering in Tsinghua University (THU). My research interests lie in the interdisciplinary area of *Data Science*, *Urban Science* and *Computational Social Science*, aiming to develop scientific methods and artificial intelligence tools to address the long-standing puzzles in complex networks arise from human behavior and social interactions. My research aims to fully exploit the opportunities offered by recent data explosion and push forward the boundary of computational social science research with novel *Data Science*/*AI* techniques. 

Prior to my current position, I was a postdoc scholar at the University of Chicago, co-advised by [Prof. Luis Bettencourt](https://voices.uchicago.edu/luisbettencourt/) and [Prof. James Evans](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/james-evans). I obtained my Ph.D. in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Yong Li](http://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/).
