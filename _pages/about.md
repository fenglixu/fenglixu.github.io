I am currently a postdoc scholar at the University of Chicago, where I am co-advised by [Prof. Luis Bettencourt](https://voices.uchicago.edu/luisbettencourt/) and [Prof. James Evans](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/james-evans).

My research interests lie in the interdisciplinary area of *Computational Social Science*, *Urban Science* and *Data Science*, aiming to develop scientific methods and artificial intelligence tools to address the long-standing puzzles in the complex networks arise from human behavior and social interactions. My research aims to fully exploit the opportunities offered by the recent data explosion and tackle the problems in social complexity research with novel *Data Science* / *AI* techniques.
